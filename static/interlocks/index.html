		<h3>Interlock Boxes</h3>
		<p>You may have noticed that several of the tools in the nanofab have interlock boxes attached to them.  These boxes have been deployed in order to enforce the requirement that each tool be enabled in coral before use.  Once a tool has been enabled in coral, a signal is sent to the associated interlock box that allows the tool to be run.  Below is a picture of one of these boxes:<br/><br/><img src="images/interlock_box.jpg" alt="Interlock Box" /></p> 
		<br/>
		<p>The box displays four LED lights to indicate the state that the machine is in.  These are intended to make it easy to tell if a machine is currently in use by a lab member and what service state the machine is in.  </p>
		<br/>
		<p>You will also notice that there is a key switch attached to each of the interlock boxes.  This switch can be turned to "service" mode or "lock out" mode by any of the nanofab staff members.  Service mode overrides any coral settings and allows the tool to be run.  Lock out prevents any use of the tool.
